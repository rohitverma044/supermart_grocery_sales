Supermart Grocery Sales Analysis

This project analyzes grocery sales data from a supermart to understand sales performance, customer behavior, and product demand. The dataset includes details such as order date, category, sub-category, region, sales, profit, discount, and quantity sold.

Along with data analysis and visualization, machine learning models are applied to predict sales and identify patterns that support better business decision-making.

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

# Machine Learning Algorithms Used

Linear Regression – to predict sales based on numerical features

Multiple Linear Regression – to analyze the impact of multiple factors on sales

Decision Tree Regressor – to capture non-linear relationships in sales data

Random Forest Regressor – for improved accuracy and feature importance analysis

# Key Tasks Performed

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature encoding and selection
